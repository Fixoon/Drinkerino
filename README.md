# Drinkerino

This Android app was created for fun and for me to learn. It's my first time using Kotlin but not first time developing in Android.

Drinkerino is about drink recipes. The app has few features. It's very basic.

The name "Drinkerino" is nothing serious.

The app is not perfect, many things could probably be done better. I'll update the app sometimes when I feel like it

The app doesn't work properly in Android P dp1. I'll fix it before Android P is released.

Don't take the recipes seriously. I haven't tested any of them.

Feel free to come with suggestions.

Thanks.

Update (2018-04-20): 
I have now switched to using MVP. I've also made changes so that MainFragment, LikesFragment and FilterDialogFragment now handles rotatoins properly.
