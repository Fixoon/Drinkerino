# Drinkerino

This Android app was created for fun and for me to learn. It's my first time using Kotlin but not first time developing in Android.

Drinkerino is about drink recipes. The app has a few features but not a lot. It's very basic.

The name "Drinkerino" is nothing serious.

There is a lot that could be done better and I might update the app if I feel like it. 

Don't take the recipes seriously. I haven't tested any of them.

Feel free to come with suggestions.

Thanks.
