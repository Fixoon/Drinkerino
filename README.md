# Drinkerino

This Android app was created for fun and to learn. It's my first time using Kotlin but not first time developing in Android.

Drinkerino is about drink recipes. The app has a few features but not a lot. The app is very basic.

Name is just something random.

Don't take the recipes seriously. I haven't tested any of them.

There is a lot that could be done better and I might update the app from time to time. 

Feel free to come with suggestions.

Thanks.
