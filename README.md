# Drinkerino

Hello. This is an Android app with drink recipes. I created it for fun, for me to learn and maybe show what I can do.

I started coding it in Java but Android Studio 3.0 came a few days after I started with Kotlin support so I decided to try it out.

The name "Drinkerino" is nothing serious.

I'm actively working on making the app better.

Don't use the recipes. ;) I haven't tested any of them.

Feel free to come with suggestions.

Thanks.

##Known problems:  
Filter dialog doesn't display properly on devices with DPI level of 640 (i.e. Galaxy S(6-9) & LG G(4-6)) in landscape.
~~The app doesn't work properly in Android P dp1. I'll fix it before Android P is released.~~ Fixed.

##Update (2018-04-20):  
I have now switched to using MVP. I've also made changes so that MainFragment, LikesFragment and FilterDialogFragment now handles rotations properly.
